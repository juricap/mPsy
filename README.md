Modular Psychophysics (mPsy)
----------------------------

<span style="font-weight: bold; color: orange">mPsy</span> is a modular approach to design of psychophysical experiments. Experiments can be built out of independent programs and modules. Programs can be in different languages.

<span style="font-weight: bold; color: orange">mPsy</span> is free, open-source, and extremely compact. It embodies a minimalist approach to programming and psychophysics. 
The core of mPsy is written in Python. It offers a library of standard stimuli and also tools for building new stimuli, static and dynamic. 

The core can be controlled using several languages. For example:

* the flow of the experiment can be written in MATLAB
* the stimulus in Python (or called from MATLAB without any knowledge of Python)
* and automatic plotting of the data in R.
