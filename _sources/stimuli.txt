Stimulus Library
================

Dot Lattice
-----------

    :width: 120px

Dot lattice stimulus is an array of dots, dots are organized along two orientations
with constant within orientation inter-dot distances.

Dots in this stimulus can be redered as gratings, so that each dot can have its own 
sptial frequency and orientation.

Random Dot Kinematograms
------------------------

    :width: 120px

Random dot kinematograms (RDK) as visual stimuli composed of randomly scattered and moving points.
Commonly used  RDK stimulus is composed of two subgroups of points, each can be controlled independently
in order to study motion perception of coherent groups in noisy (in-coherent) backgrounds.

This stimulus displays only a single group, multiple groups can be obtain by overlaying multiple
instances of ths stimulus.

Tiled Image
-----------

    :width: 120px

Tiled image is a stimulus object that enables the presentation of images. 
Images can be shown unmodified, scaled, rotated, or on tiles obtained by splitting the image 
by a regular grid. Some properties of tiles can be controlled independently.

Grating
-------

    :align: right
    :width: 120px

One of the most elementary vision stimulus, periodic grating with periodically changing contrast. 
The contrast can be controled (modulated) in space and time. This stimulus has a built in
gaussian mask, which can be used as a circular aperture.

Cube
----

.. image:: assets/stimuli/0007.png
    :align: right
    :width: 120px

Cube arbitrarily rotated and scaled in three dimensions. The colors of vertices and faces can 
be controlled.

Alphabet Grid for BCI Spelling
------------------------------

.. image:: assets/stimuli/0005.png
    :align: right
    :width: 120px

A grid of letters commonly used in Brain Computer Interface (BCI) research. 
Letter of alphabet are shown in 6x6 grid, cells of this grid can be periodically highlighted.
This stimulus sends events on each update of stimulus, so they can be logged for ERP analysis.
