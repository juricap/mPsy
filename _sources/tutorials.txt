
Tutorials for Modular Psychophysics (mPsy)
=========================================

Installation
------------

If you haven't downloaded Modular Psychophysics yes, click on this `link <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/166463/visionpyg/downloads/mpsy_minimal.zip>`_.

The core of Modular Psychophysics requires only `Python <http://python.org>`_ to run. One other essential dependency is bundled with the package.
However, we also suggest installing `Numerical Python (numpy) <http://numpy.org>`_.  
it is very likely that even the most simple experiment will require some numerical computation.
Some of the stimuli we use in tutorials use Python's Numpy module.

If you are completely new to Python, we suggest installing the free version of `Enthought Python Distribution <https://www.enthought.com/products/epd/>`_,
recently rebranded as `Canopy Express <https://www.enthought.com/products/epd/free/>`_. 
For Mac OS users this distribution seems to be one of very few reliable ways of getting all scientific packages (especially matplotlib) working without a problem.

Getting Started
---------------

Although mPsy's core is written in Python, it can be controlled from other lanuguages.
Working examples of controlling mPsy presentation remotely are available for the following languages:
