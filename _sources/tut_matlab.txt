Installation
------------

The standard `distribution <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/166463/mpsy/download/mpsy_matlab.zip>`_ of mPsy contains a sample experiment in which MATLAB is used to define the timeline of the experiment and its parameters. 

Presentation of stimuli requires a working installation of Python as described in :doc:`tutorials`. Once Python is installed, extract the archived mPsy package into an empty directory.

Sample experiment
-----------------

Here stimulus presentation is carried by Python. MATLAB is used to control the experiment remotely. Python listens to MATLAB commands and executes them.

The following is a "blank" experiment that presents no stimuli.

.. literalinclude:: ../../mPsy/examples/exp_tut_webremote.py

Remote control is enabled by the following code.

.. literalinclude:: ../../mPsy/examples/exp_tut_webremote.py
    :lines: 14-19

In a complete experiment, the timing and identity of stimuli is controlled from MATLAB. Python presents stimuli, collect subject's responses, and makes the collected information available for MATLAB to pick up.

The MATLAB side of this experiment looks as follows.

.. highlight:: matlab
.. literalinclude:: ../../mPsy/examples/matlab/exp_tut4.m

To run this demonstration:

* Copy the above snippet into MATLAB (starting with ``mimport``).
* Run the ``exp_tut_webremote.py`` 

  * To accomplish this, double-click the file name 
  * or execute it by typing ``python exp_tut_webremote.py`` in the Terminal.
 
* A successfully executed Python program creates an empty  black screen 

  * or a black window when ``fullscreen`` option is off.

* At this point you can go to MATLAB, change you directory to that containing

  * file ``exp_tut4.m``
  * file ``mimport.m``
  * subdirectory ``matlab`` 
  
and run ``exp_tut4``.

The syntax of the MATLAB experiment is modelled after the Python examples. The main tutorial in :doc:`tutorials` explains how to define parameters of the stimuli and the timeline.

Recording responses
-------------------

On every event triggered by mPsy (or by subject's response) information is added to mPsy event log as described in tutorial :doc:`tut_python`. To catch events in MATLAB we regularly check for the messages accumulating on the Python side:

.. literalinclude:: ../../mPsy/examples/matlab/exp_tut4.m
    :lines: 56-63
